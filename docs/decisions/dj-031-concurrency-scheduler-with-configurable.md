## DJ-031: Concurrency Scheduler with Configurable Resource Limits

**Status:** shipping

**Decision:** A concurrency scheduler separates what CAN run in parallel (DAG topology) from what WILL run in parallel (resource availability). Configurable limits per-agent and globally.

**Why:** The DAG says "4 workstreams can run in parallel" but Claude Max might only support 2 concurrent sessions. Codex might have its own limits. The user's machine might not handle 5 worktrees. The scheduler is a standard job-queue pattern (ready queue → running slots → blocked) with configurable limits that the user sets based on their subscription and hardware.
