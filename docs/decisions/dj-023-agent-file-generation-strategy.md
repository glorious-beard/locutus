## DJ-023: Agent File Generation Strategy

**Status:** shipped

**Decision:** Locutus generates CLAUDE.md as the primary agent instruction file and symlinks AGENTS.md to it. SKILL.md files (open standard, agentskills.io) are generated per-strategy in `.agents/skills/` and referenced from CLAUDE.md.

**Research finding:** AGENTS.md is a Linux Foundation standard (60k+ repos) but Claude Code doesn't read it natively (feature request #6235). Claude Code reads CLAUDE.md and its own `.claude/` ecosystem. SKILL.md is an open standard supported by all major tools (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini).

**What we DON'T generate:** `.claude/agents/` definitions and `.claude/memory/` files. These are Claude Code internals for its own sub-agent orchestration and session recall. They're orthogonal to Locutus's spec management.
