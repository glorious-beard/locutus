## DJ-002: Console Output Library

**Status:** shipped

**Decision:** Use `pterm` for rich terminal output.

**Alternatives considered:**
- `text/tabwriter` (stdlib) — too basic for the UX we want
- `charmbracelet/lipgloss` + `bubbletea` — better for full TUI apps, overkill for CLI output
- Custom rendering

**Why pterm:** Closest Go equivalent to Python's "rich" library. Tables, spinners, progress bars, tree views, colored text — all without building a full TUI. The user explicitly asked for rich console output comparable to Python's ecosystem.
