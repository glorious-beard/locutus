## DJ-058: Churn and Retry Are Distinct

**Status:** shipped

**Decision:** Churn and retry are separate supervision phenomena:

- **Retry** is vertical — a new attempt after a failure signal (validation rejected, test failed, timeout). Lives in the outer `Supervisor.Supervise` loop.
- **Churn** is horizontal — repeating action cycles within a single attempt detected from the event stream. Causes the current attempt to abort early to save tokens.

Churn-aborted attempts feed the retry loop with pattern-specific feedback. Two consecutive churn-aborts on the same step escalate to `RefineStep` because the step itself is likely the problem.

**Why:** Conflating them leads to wrong responses. A step that churns and then recovers (cycle, then validation failure normally) isn't the same as a step that consistently cycles. The distinct counter (`consecutiveChurns`) separates these modes cleanly.
