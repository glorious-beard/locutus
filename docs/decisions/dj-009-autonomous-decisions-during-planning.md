## DJ-009: Autonomous Decisions During Planning

**Status:** shipped

**Decision:** Locutus makes all decisions autonomously during planning (status: `assumed`, with confidence score). No `input_needed` during planning.

**Journey:**
1. Initially planned multi-turn conversations with `input_needed` chains during planning
2. Problem: forwarding feedback from the planning LLM to the user and back is complex, especially through MCP
3. Solution: Locutus decides everything itself, documents rationale and alternatives via the historian, and the user reviews later via `locutus status` / `locutus revisit`
4. `input_needed` only occurs during explicit `revisit` — the user asked to change something, so clarifying questions are appropriate

**Why autonomous:** Simpler MCP contract. Plans are always fully resolved and self-contained. No mid-planning callbacks. Aligns with D-004 from PLAN.md (Passive Generation Model).
